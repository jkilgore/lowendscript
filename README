:Low End Bootstrap Scripts:
This script is to setup low end virtual servers.

:How to Use:
wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/jkilgore/lowendscript/master/setup-debian.sh
bash setup-debian.sh (system|exim4|nginx|mysql|php)

:What It Does:
system -- removes some commonly bundled applications for a minimal distro (apache2, bind9, samba, nscd, etc).
exim4 -- installs as a replacement to sendmail with internet delivery enabled.
nginx -- basic nginx install via apt-get
mysql -- sets MySQL root password during install and disables InnoDB.
php -- installs PHP5 CLI, FPM, and CGI. FPM should reduce the need for custom FCGI handler.

:App Replacements:
openssh -- dropbear, invoked from xinetd
rsyslog -- inetutils-syslogd
sendmail -- exim4, optional

This script is provided as is and depending on your base configuration your mileage may vary.
